''' statement
--------------------------
Conditional statements are one of the most powerful tools in programming—they let your code make decisions based on certain conditions.
Think of them as the "if this, then that" logic that guides how a program behaves.

🌟 Basics of Conditional Statements
-> if statement: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.

-> else statement: Executes a block of code if the condition is false.

-> elif (else if): Lets you check multiple conditions in sequence.
